This web app is developed using yarn and react

\
\
to start it on localhost:

Firstly install all the dependencies using the "yarn install" command

Secondly run "yarn start" to run it on localhost

I've developed this calendar/eventScheduler using the help from react documentation and other online resources.

For date and time, I've used dayjs
